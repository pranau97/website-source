Hi, I'm Pranau. I'm a third-year CS student at Vellore Institute of Technology, India. I love programming and playing Civilization (just one more turn!!). I code in the language that helps me get the job done. Usually, more often than not, that language is Python. Having been involved with a rusty ol' PC from a young age, I love tinkering with computers and gadgets - customizing them, improving them (or breaking them). But it's time for the computers to do this themselves and that's what I've set out to do - make machines learn!

I am available for hire.
